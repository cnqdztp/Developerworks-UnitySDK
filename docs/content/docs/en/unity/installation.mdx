# Installation

There are three methods to install the Developerworks Unity SDK in your project.

## Method 1: Unity Package Manager (Recommended)

This is the easiest and recommended way to install the SDK.

1. Open Unity Package Manager: `Window > Package Manager`
2. Click the `+` button in the top-left corner
3. Select `Add package from git URL...`
4. Enter the following URL:

```
https://github.com/cnqdztp/Developerworks-UnitySDK.git
```

5. Click `Add` and wait for Unity to download and import the package

## Method 2: Download and Import

If you prefer manual installation:

1. Go to the [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/cnqdztp/Developerworks-UnitySDK/releases)
2. Download the latest release package
3. Extract the contents to `Assets/Developerworks_SDK/` in your Unity project
4. Unity will automatically import the SDK

## Method 3: Git Submodule

For advanced users who want to keep the SDK updated via Git:

```bash
cd your-unity-project
git submodule add https://github.com/cnqdztp/Developerworks-UnitySDK.git Assets/Developerworks_SDK
```

## Verification

After installation, verify that the SDK is properly installed:

1. In Unity, navigate to `Assets/Developerworks_SDK/`
2. You should see the following folders:
   - `Prefab/`
   - `Scripts/`
   - `Examples/`

## Next Steps

Now that you have installed the SDK, proceed to the [Quick Start](/en/docs/unity/quick-start) guide to set up your first integration.
